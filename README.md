# üìä E-Learning Analytics Dashboard with TabNet-Powered Course Completion Predictions

An interactive analytics dashboard for an e-learning platform designed to provide insights into course enrollments, user engagement, and completion rates. This project uses a **TabNet deep learning model** to predict the likelihood of course completion, helping enhance strategic decision-making for education platforms.

Developed as a showcase for the **Coursera Operations Associate** role, it highlights proficiency in AI, Data Engineering, Visualization, and Full-Stack Development.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Overview

Stored in MySQL (`elearning_platform`) with 500 records:
- **users**: User ID, name, join date
- **courses**: Course ID, name, rating, price, category
- **enrollments**: User ID, course ID, enrollment date, completion status

**Prediction Features**:
- Course rating, price, one-hot encoded category
- Days since user joined/enrolled
- User enrollment count, avg category rating, course popularity

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- MySQL Server
- Git

### üì• Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-learning-platform-analytics.git
   cd e-learning-platform-analytics
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit==1.31.0 pandas==2.2.2 numpy sqlalchemy==2.0.23 \
               mysql-connector-python==7.0.2 plotly==3.10.0 joblib==1.3.1 \
               torch==2.2.2 pytorch-tabnet==4.1.0 scikit-learn==1.4.0 imblearn==0.12.3
   ```

4. **Configure the MySQL database:**
   - Create the database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE elearning_platform;
     ```
   - Import schema and data:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p elearning_platform < schema.sql
     ```

   - Update the MySQL credentials in `train_model.py` and `app.py`:
     ```python
     engine = create_engine("mysql+mysqlconnector://root:your_password@localhost/elearning_platform")
     ```

5. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   - Outputs:
     - `best_model.zip` ‚Äì trained TabNet model
     - `scaler.pkl` ‚Äì preprocessor
     - `feature_columns.pkl` ‚Äì selected features

6. **Run the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   - Open in browser: `http://localhost:8501`
